# Python - Pokemon Showdown Random Battles text file writer
## Concept
While learning Python I thought that the best way to actually learn would be by creating a project that would serve me for something.
The idea of this script is to fetch the [https://pkmn.github.io/randbats/] endpoints and convert the received sets in JSON format to a text file so I could import them to Pok√©mon Showdown or PKHEX.
I'd like to keep this repository updated so that in the future, every time I reach a milestone in my Python learning process, I'd see the evolution of the code and the application of best practices into it.
